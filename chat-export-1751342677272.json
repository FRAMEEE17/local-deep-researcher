This system would leverage data from CCTV and infrared cameras, incorporating time series analysis and computer vision techniques to monitor animal behavior and identify potential indicators of disease, such as vomit. The model would then classify the risk of disease and alert zookeepers. To achieve the desired \"zookeeper agent\" functionality, the model would need to integrate tools like internet connectivity and potentially Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for communication and data management, enabling it to act as an automated assistant for zookeepers. All data collected from the cameras would be stored in a database for AI analysis, facilitating comprehensive monitoring and pattern recognition.\n\nA key aspect of this system involves analyzing animal behavior and identifying potential indicators of disease using computer vision. Several model architectures and open-source options exist for this purpose. The integration of deep learning-based vision and language models, as demonstrated in recent work, could be a starting point. For computer vision tasks like disease detection, consider exploring open-source models used in veterinary diagnostics. For the broader \"zookeeper agent\" functionality, a Large Language Model (LLM) or Vision-Language Model (VLM) could be employed to manage tools and interpret data, potentially leveraging frameworks used in ecological reporting. A specific example from April 2025 research suggests exploring \"iADCPS: Time Series Anomaly Detection for Evolving Cyber-physical Systems via Incremental Meta-learning\" for the time series analysis component crucial for behavior monitoring, which is a key factor in detecting changes indicative of illness. The pipeline would involve data acquisition from CCTV and infrared cameras, storage in a database, time series analysis to identify behavioral anomalies, computer vision analysis for disease indicators, risk classification, and alerts to zookeepers, all managed by the \"zookeeper agent\" utilizing tools like internet connectivity and MQTT.\n\n ### Sources:\n* Towards Context-Rich Automated Biodiversity Assessments : https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/24/8122\n* Frontiers | Review of applications of deep learning in veterinary ... : https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2025.1511522/full\n* Artificial Intelligence Apr 2025 : http://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/2025-04?skip=75&show=2000","model":"data_analyst","modelName":"Local Deep Researcher","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1751342568,"statusHistory":[{"description":"üöÄ Starting deep research process...","done":false},{"description":"üîç Generating search queries...","done":false},{"description":"üåê Research loop 2: Gathering information...","done":false},{"description":"üìä Analyzing and summarizing sources...","done":false},{"description":"ü§î Identifying knowledge gaps...","done":false},{"description":"üåê Research loop 3: Gathering information...","done":false},{"description":"üìä Analyzing and summarizing sources...","done":false},{"description":"ü§î Identifying knowledge gaps...","done":false},{"description":"Research complete!","done":true}],"lastSentence":"Sources:\nTowards Context-Rich Automated Biodiversity Assessments : https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/24/8122\nFrontiers | Review of applications of deep learning in veterinary ...","done":true}},"currentId":"b551fbd6-e5d2-4077-be19-e61e096f1c9e"},"messages":[{"id":"064f7458-7584-42b3-aea1-70d39c71c88e","parentId":null,"childrenIds":["b551fbd6-e5d2-4077-be19-e61e096f1c9e"],"role":"user","content":"I'm doing the AI model which is about detecting the animal diseases in the zoo to help zookeeper by using the CCTV camera and infared camera to detect the animal behaviour which it will use time series to be the factors, and all of the data will be stored into the Database for AI analyzing\n  \nand also we integrate the computer vision to detect animals, and more like animal vomit (diseases or sickness) and after analyzing the model can classify and tell the risk that animal might got that diseases....\n  \nso I want the model act like an zookeeper agent to use tools calling like connect to the internet or using MCP for this scenarios\n  \nso can you do research and write the pipeline for me please? and also write the model architectures for me an suggest the opensource AI model for me too for both LLM or VLM or computer vision model","timestamp":1751342568,"models":["data_analyst"]},{"parentId":"064f7458-7584-42b3-aea1-70d39c71c88e","id":"b551fbd6-e5d2-4077-be19-e61e096f1c9e","childrenIds":[],"role":"assistant","content":"# Deep Research Results\n\n**Topic:** I'm doing the AI model which is about detecting the animal diseases in the zoo to help zookeeper by using the CCTV camera and infared camera to detect the animal behaviour which it will use time series to be the factors, and all of the data will be stored into the Database for AI analyzing\n  \nand also we integrate the computer vision to detect animals, and more like animal vomit (diseases or sickness) and after analyzing the model can classify and tell the risk that animal might got that diseases....\n  \nso I want the model act like an zookeeper agent to use tools calling like connect to the internet or using MCP for this scenarios\n  \nso can you do research and write the pipeline for me please? and also write the model architectures for me an suggest the opensource AI model for me too for both LLM or VLM or computer vision model\n\n## Summary\nRecent research highlights the growing application of deep learning in both ecological assessments and veterinary diagnostics, suggesting a potential pathway for an AI-powered \"zookeeper agent\" capable of detecting and classifying animal diseases in a zoo setting.
