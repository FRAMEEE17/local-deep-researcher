Research Topic: {research_topic}
Intent Classification: {search_intent} (confidence: {intent_confidence:.2f})
</CONTEXT>

<CRITICAL_ARXIV_DETECTION>
üö® MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Check for ArXiv patterns in the research topic!

STEP 1: Scan for ArXiv patterns:
- URLs: https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX OR https://arxiv.org/html/XXXX.XXXXX OR https://arxiv.org/pdf/XXXX.XXXXX
- IDs: Pattern XXXX.XXXXX (4 digits, dot, 4-5 digits, optional v1/v2/etc)

STEP 2: If ANY ArXiv pattern found:
‚ùó CRITICAL: You MUST extract the paper ID and use ONLY that ID as your query
‚ùó DO NOT use the full URL or add extra words

EXAMPLES (follow these exactly):
‚úì Input: "explain https://arxiv.org/html/2410.21338v2 this paper"
‚úì Output: {{"query": "2410.21338"}}

‚úì Input: "analyze paper 1706.03762v1 methodology" 
‚úì Output: {{"query": "1706.03762"}}


STEP 3: If NO ArXiv pattern found, proceed with normal optimization below.
</CRITICAL_ARXIV_DETECTION>

<INTENT_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY>
Based on the classified intent (after ArXiv override), optimize the query:

**Academic Intent (arxiv_search)**:
- For ArXiv URLs/IDs: Extract paper ID and relevant keywords
- Use precise technical terminology and methodology keywords
- Include field-specific jargon and research concepts
- Focus on methodological approaches and theoretical frameworks
- Example: "transformer attention mechanism parameter efficiency"

**Web Intent (web_search)**:
- Add temporal qualifiers: "latest", "2024", "recent developments" 
- Include trending terms and current event context
- Use discoverable language for broader audiences
- Example: "latest AI transformer developments 2024 breakthrough"

**Hybrid Intent (hybrid_search)**:
- Balance precision with discoverability
- Combine technical terms with accessible language
- Include both theoretical and practical aspects
- Example: "transformer architecture advances 2024 performance benchmarks"
</INTENT_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY>

<VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST>
Before generating your query, verify:
‚úì Query matches the detected intent classification
‚úì Terminology appropriate for target sources (academic vs web)
‚úì Current date context included where relevant
‚úì Query is specific enough to avoid broad, irrelevant results
‚úó Avoid overly generic terms that lead to information overload
</VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
{{{{
    "query": "optimized search string tailored to {search_intent}",
    "rationale": "explanation of optimization strategy and intent alignment",
    "optimization_type": "{search_intent}",
    "confidence_level": "high|medium|low based on intent classification confidence"
}}}}
</OUTPUT_FORMAT>

<QUALITY_ASSURANCE>
Rate your query optimization on these criteria:
- Intent Alignment: Does it match the classified search strategy?
- Specificity: Is it targeted enough to avoid irrelevant results?
- Discoverability: Will it find relevant information in the target sources?
- Temporal Relevance: Does it account for recency requirements?
</QUALITY_ASSURANCE>

Think step-by-step about the knowledge gaps:

**Thought 1: Content Analysis**
- What are the main topics covered in the current summary?
- What is the depth of coverage for each topic?
- Are there any surface-level treatments that need deeper exploration?

**Action 1: Gap Prioritization**
Identify the most critical knowledge gaps in order of importance:
1. **Technical Implementation Gaps**: Missing how-to details, code examples, methodologies
2. **Performance & Benchmarks**: Lacking quantitative comparisons, metrics, evaluations  
3. **Recent Developments**: Missing 2024-2025 updates, current trends, latest research
4. **Practical Applications**: Limited real-world use cases, implementation challenges
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Insufficient comparisons with alternatives or competing approaches

**Observation 1: Confidence Assessment**
- Which claims in the summary have low confidence levels?
- What evidence is missing to strengthen weak assertions?
- Where do sources conflict or provide incomplete information?
</REACT_REASONING_FRAMEWORK>

<SOPHISTICATED_GAP_ANALYSIS>
For the identified priority gap, analyze:

**Gap Characterization:**
- Specific vs General: Is this a specific technical detail or broad conceptual area?
- Temporal: Is this about current state, historical development, or future trends?
- Practical vs Theoretical: Does this gap affect understanding or implementation?

**Source Strategy Optimization:**
- Academic Gap ‚Üí Use technical terminology, research paper keywords
- Current/Trending Gap ‚Üí Include "2024", "latest", "recent developments"  
- Implementation Gap ‚Üí Add "tutorial", "guide", "examples", "implementation"
- Comparative Gap ‚Üí Include "vs", "comparison", "benchmark", "evaluation"

- Template: "[technical term] [methodology] [evaluation/comparison] [recent work]"

**For Web Intent**: Current trends, practical applications  
- Template: "[topic] [latest/2024] [practical applications] [implementation]"

**For Hybrid Intent**: Balanced technical and accessible terms
- Template: "[technical concept] [recent advances] [performance] [practical use]"
</QUERY_OPTIMIZATION_ENGINE>

<CONFIDENCE_CALIBRATION>
Rate your gap identification confidence:
- **High (0.8+)**: Clear, specific gap with obvious search strategy
- **Medium (0.5-0.8)**: Identified gap but search strategy may need refinement
- **Low (<0.5)**: Uncertain about gap importance or best search approach
